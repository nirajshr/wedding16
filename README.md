# Abina & Niraj Wedding websuite
This website was created using HTML, CSS & JavaScript (client side).
Bootstrap was used to create a responsive layout that works well across phone, tablet and PC.


# How do I get started?
You will need npm installed in your dev environment to build the package.

1. First clone this repo
2. Go into the root directory of the repo. Install dependencies by running:

```
   npm install
```

3. The frontend JavaScript needs to be built using npm. Build the client.js file by:

```
   npm run build
```
That will create assets/js/app.js file used by the index.html

4. Open client/index.html
