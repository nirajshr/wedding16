Bootstrap was used to create a responsive layout that works well across phone, tablet and PC.


# How do I get started?
You will need npm installed in your dev environment to build the package.

* First clone this repo
* Go into the root directory of the repo. Install dependencies by running:

```

* The frontend JavaScript needs to be built using npm. Build the client.js file by:

```
